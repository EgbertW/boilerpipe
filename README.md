==========

Boilerplate Removal and Fulltext Extraction from HTML pages

This is a fork of the excellent yet abandoned boilerpipe by Dr. Christan Kohlsch√ºtter available at https://github.com/kohlschutter/boilerpipe

It was forked on the additions done by [dankito](https://github.com/dankito/boilerpipe).

Main difference from these repositories:
- Remove included nekohtml and depend on Maven resource instead
- Apply for inclusion in JCenter
- Name change to avoid namespace conflicts
